# Problem Statement 
Sign Langauge detection Using Python and Open CV

# Overview
This project aims to develop a robust sign language recognition system using Python and OpenCV, leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the Pre-Trained SSD MobileNet V2 architecture. 
The system is designed to recognize signs with 70-80% accuracy in various environments, facilitating communication for the deaf community and aiding learners in practicing sign language.

#  Key Features
1. Real-Time Recognition: Capture and recognize sign language gestures in real-time using a webcam.
2. High Accuracy: Utilizes a pre-trained SSD MobileNet V2 model fine-tuned for sign language recognition.
3. User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for capturing live video input and displaying recognized gestures.
4. Accessibility: Includes features like adjustable font sizes, high contrast modes, and audio feedback options.

# Tech Stack 
1.  Python: The primary programming language for implementing machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques.
2.  OpenCV: Used for capturing video input from the camera and processing the video frames.
3. TensorFlow/Keras: Utilized for building and training the convolutional neural network (CNN) model for gesture recognition.
4. CNN: The core of the system, responsible for extracting features from the video frames and classifying them into sign language gestures.
5. Real-time Processing: Techniques such as frame differencing and motion detection will be used for real-time processing of sign language gestures.
6. Graphical User Interface (GUI): A GUI will be developed to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system, displaying the recognized gestures and their corresponding meanings.

   
# Objectives
1. Develop a sign language recognition system using Python and OpenCV.
2. Achieve high accuracy in sign recognition through a CNN architecture.
3. Provide real-time feedback for sign language learners.
4. Enhance inclusivity and accessibility for the deaf community.
