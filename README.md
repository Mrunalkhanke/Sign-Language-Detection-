*SIGN-LANGUAGE-DETECTION*


**Overview**

This project aims to develop a robust sign language recognition system using Python and OpenCV, leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the Pre-Trained SSD MobileNet V2 architecture. 
The system is designed to recognize signs with 70-80% accuracy in various environments, facilitating communication for the deaf community and aiding learners in practicing sign language.

**Features**

1. Real-Time Recognition: Capture and recognize sign language gestures in real-time using a webcam.
2. High Accuracy: Utilizes a pre-trained SSD MobileNet V2 model fine-tuned for sign language recognition.
3. User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for capturing live video input and displaying recognized gestures.
4. Accessibility: Includes features like adjustable font sizes, high contrast modes, and audio feedback options.
   
**Objectives**

1. Develop a sign language recognition system using Python and OpenCV.
2. Achieve high accuracy in sign recognition through a CNN architecture.
3. Provide real-time feedback for sign language learners.
4. Enhance inclusivity and accessibility for the deaf community.
